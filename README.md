# Jquery-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe game using jquery and bootstrap

## Description

The goal was to create a working game of tic-tac-toe by following these requirements:

Using any of the tools you've worked with so far, create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

1. Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game grid using your HTML element of choice.
2. When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
3. A heading should say whether it is X's or O's turn and change with each move made.
4. A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
5. When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap alert or similar Bootstrap component should appear across the screen announcing the winner.


Some of the Bootstrap code was lifted from a previous project such as the navbar and footer. The HTML was created first using Bootstrap properties. Custom CSS styling using SCSS was utilized. The game logic is all contained in the script file using the jQuery library. The game requires two people to play.
